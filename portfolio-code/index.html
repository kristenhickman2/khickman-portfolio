            <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
            <div class="half-width">
              <p>I'm an Atlanta transplant from upstate New York. Here I met a nice boy from the south, and we have made a nice life in the suburbs with our two small daughters. My coding journey started after working in Customer Service for nearly 15 years. At the time, I worked with a young guy who was teaching himself computer languages through online sources instead of the traditional route of college. I had already received a four-year degree from The University of Georgia, and did not want to waste any time in learning a completely new skillset.</p>

            <div class="half-width">
              <p>However, after my former work aquaintace told me he had just acquired a developer job with a prestigious tech company in the area, I knew that was a path I could happily follow. I found a few reputible sites, and began consuming as much about computer languages that I could. I have had many opportunities working with groups in Hackathons and participating in Open Source Projects on GitHub. I also have found it very enjoyable and rewarding working on my projects in a remote environment. Working on my own has kept me focused and motivated.</p>
